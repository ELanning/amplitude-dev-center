## Considerations

- This integration is only available for customers who have paid plans with Amplitude.
- You must enable this integration in each Amplitude project you want to use it in.
- You need a paid WebEngage plan to enable this integration.
- Amplitude matches the user_id to the CUID within WebEngage to associated cohorts. If a user with that id doesn't exist within WebEngage, a user is not created. Make sure that the Amplitude user_id field matches the WebEngage id field i.e. CUID to avoid user duplication.
